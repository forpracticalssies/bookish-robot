Hello World !!!
This is the first file in my new Git Repo

And this is a newly added line


Always do it on my own
So I gotta get through it
And the only thing I know
Is to love what I'm doing
Never give up, never slow
Till I finally prove it
Never listen to the no's
I just wanna keep moving

This is the line that I added while working on the child branch
